# Preparation before entering the server

Before entering the Minecraft server, you need to do several preparations.

## What you need to prepare

First, you need to prepare a Minecraft client. The version of Minecraft we are using is `1.17.1`. You can join and play whether you are using the premium or cracked client. For the differences, please see [Differences between premium and cracked](#difference-between-premium-and-cracked) below.

Second, depending on your community (Kaiheila or Discord), check [Connect from Kaiheila](./kaiheila-player.md) or  [Connect from discord](./discord-player.md) to register.

Finally, you are ready to enter the Minecraft server! There are a few more actions you need to perform after entering the server, please check [First time to the server](../first-join/first-join.md) for instructions.

## Differences between premium and cracked

The Minecraft server offers two login points, one for premium players and one for cracked players. Whether you are a premium player or a cracked player, you can access the server to play. But there are some differences between the two.

We recommend you to use a premium Minecraft account. Learn more on [Minecraft official website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us).

- The premium player login point has global connection acceleration, while the cracked player login point only has nodes in mainland China
- Premium players will have skins and capes as they play on a premium server, while cracked players will not have them and cannot customize them, with the default skins being Steve or Alex.
- Premium players can change their Minecraft player name on the official Mojang or Microsoft websites, which will not affect their saves on the server, but cracked players cannot change their player name, which will cause you to be blocked by the server account authentication plugin and lose your saves.
- A cracked player's name is restricted, when you first log in, the server will check your player name, if the player name is the same as one the current premium player name, the server will deny your login. After you log in for the first time and successfully bind to Discord or Kaiheila, then, the server will not deny your login if your player name is occupied by a premium player. But if one day, the premium player comes to the server, you will be asked to change your player name.
- Cracked players will need to register with the command when they first enter the server, and will be asked to enter their password once every time they log in, or switch to another server in the server cluster, while premium players will not be asked to do so.
