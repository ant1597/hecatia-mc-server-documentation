# Beta Version FAQ

## I am not a Bilibili Live Guard/Twitcher Subscriber/Patreon Supporter, can I enter the serverï¼Ÿ

Yes, you can. You will get one of the four permission group `Wind` `Aqua` `Fire` `Earth` which depends on your choice on Kaiheila or Discord.

Since only Telapis is currently open, you will not be able to obtain a plot in the residential areas around the main city.

Survival and Resource Server 'Nibiru Nature Development Area' is open to all players and you can play there. Or you can look for a companion who can get plot in Telapis and let him give you permission to build in the plot, so you can play together.

## Are there restrictions on redstone devices?

Most, no.

Be kind to the server and don't make the machinery that need a lot of performance.

- Chunk loader is not allowed
- Don't, and we do not recommand to use the spawn point chunks, the features of the spawn point chunks may not work due to various plugins

## When will other main cities be open?

Other main cities have not yet been announced by Hecatia. We do not know the exact time.

## No more plots!

It will take time to add a new area, and we apologize for the distress caused, please be patient.

## Will minecraft's version be updated with an official update?

Not necessarily, we need to make sure that all plugins are working properly in the new version before we update the server.
