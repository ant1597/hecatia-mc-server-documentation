# First time to the server


There are some authentication operations that need to be performed to access the server for the first time.

## Attention

1. Please make sure you have completed preparation period in at Kaiheila or Discord.
2. We recommend playing with premium Minecraft account, which will give you great convenience in terms of authentication.
3. Cracked players cannot use the player name of an existing premium player, you can check if it is occupied by entering the Minecraft player name at [This Website](https://mcuuid.net/)
4. Prepare your `Minecraft 1.17.1`


***If your cracked player name is already occupied by a premium player, you will be kicked from the server and receive the following message***
